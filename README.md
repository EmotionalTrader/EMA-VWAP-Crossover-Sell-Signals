# EMA-VWAP-Crossover-Sell-Signals
Pine Script indicator for spotting low-risk, high-reward short setups.   Best used on 3-minute candlesticks for scalping, this tool combines Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) with VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and multiple resistance band levels to identify overextended conditions and early reversal opportunities.
