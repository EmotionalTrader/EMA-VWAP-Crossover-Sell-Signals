# EMA VWAP Early Sell Signal with Expanded Resistance

A **TradingView Pine Script** indicator for spotting **low-risk, high-reward short setups**.  
Best used on **3-minute candlesticks** for scalping, this tool combines **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)** with **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)** and multiple resistance band levels to identify overextended conditions and early reversal opportunities.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Not recommended for use during **low-volume periods** or **algo-dominated trading sessions**, as signals may be unreliable in thin markets.

## üõ† How It Works
1. **EMA Crossunder** ‚Äî Fast EMA crosses below Slow EMA = potential bearish reversal.
2. **Resistance Zone Check** ‚Äî Price must be at or above VWAP, near defined resistance bands.
3. **Signal Classification**:
   - **Band 1‚Äì2** = mild overextension, early warning.
   - **Band 2‚Äì3** = stronger overextension, higher conviction.
   - **Above Band 3** = extreme overextension, highest conviction.
4. **Stop-Loss Marking**:
   - If price rallies by a set amount after a signal, label as ‚ÄúWRONG‚Äù for review.

## ‚ö° Use Cases
- **Scalping short entries** during intraday reversals.
- **Taking profits** on long positions at potential exhaustion points.
- Filtering trades with both **trend (EMA)** and **mean reversion (VWAP)** signals.
